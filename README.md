# Twitter-Blockchain

This is a small self sustained reporting system created for Twitter using Blockchain.The Initial Script uses the tweepy API and Natural Language Processing to filter out potentially negative Tweets. These tweets are then voted upon by a group of test users through a blockchain based voting system to decide if a given tweet is harmful or not. A future plan for an automated scoring system for the group of test users and tags to show their bais which can automatically add new users and remove undesired users, are in development.
